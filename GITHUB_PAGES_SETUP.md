# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Fix GitHub Pages Configuration

## ❌ Current Issue
Your website is not loading because GitHub Pages is configured incorrectly.

## ✅ Correct Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Visit: https://github.com/yasirSub/YasirSubhani_Portfilo
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (near the top)

### Step 2: Configure Pages Source
1. Scroll down to **"Pages"** section (left sidebar)
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Check Actions Tab
1. Click **"Actions"** tab
2. You should see a workflow called **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"**
3. Click on it to see the build progress

## 🔧 Why This Happens

- **Wrong Source**: You selected "Deploy from a branch" but your website files are in the `dist` folder
- **GitHub Actions**: The correct way is to use GitHub Actions to build and deploy from the `dist` folder
- **Build Process**: Your React app needs to be built first, then the built files deployed

## 📱 What Happens After Fix

1. **GitHub Actions** will automatically build your website
2. **Build time**: 2-5 minutes for first deployment
3. **Your website** will be available at: https://yasirsub.github.io/YasirSubhani_Portfilo/

## 🚀 Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you still have issues, you can manually deploy:

1. **Build locally**: `npm run build`
2. **Go to Settings → Pages**
3. **Select "Deploy from a branch"**
4. **Choose "main" branch**
5. **Select "/docs" folder** (create this folder first)
6. **Copy dist contents to docs folder**

## 📞 Need Help?

- Check the **Actions** tab for error messages
- Make sure your repository is public
- Verify all files are pushed to GitHub

**The key is to use "GitHub Actions" as the source, not "Deploy from a branch"!**
