## How to Access Your 3D Portfolio on Your Phone

### Method 1: Using the Batch File (Recommended)

1. **Double-click** the `start-mobile.bat` file in your project folder
2. The script will automatically:
   - Show your local IP address
   - Start the development server
   - Display the URL to access on your phone

### Method 2: Manual Setup

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:network
   ```

2. **Find your PC's IP address:**
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: `ipconfig`
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)

3. **Access on your phone:**
   - Make sure your phone is connected to the same WiFi network as your PC
   - Open your phone's browser
